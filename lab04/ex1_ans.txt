1.What do the .data, .word, .text directives mean (i.e. what do you use them for)? Hint: think about the 4 sections of memory.
(A).text means put the following into the program memory.
(B).word means put a data with value in a length of a word in the data memory.
(C).data means the following variables shall be in the data memory.

2.Run the program to completion. What number did the program output? What does this number represent?
34.
The 9th fib number.

3.At what address is n stored in memory? Hint: Look at the contents of the registers.
A: 0x10000010. 

4.Without actually editing the code (i.e. without going into the “Editor” tab), have the program calculate the 13th fib number (0-indexed) by manually modifying the value of a register. You may find it helpful to first step through the code. If you prefer to look at decimal values, change the “Display Settings” option at the bottom.
Change t3 to 13.
