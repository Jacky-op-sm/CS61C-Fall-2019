1.The register representing the variable k.
t0.

2.The registers acting as pointers to the source and dest arrays.
pointers to the source arrays: t1.
pointers to the dest arrays: t2.
But the actual moving point for them are t4, t6.

3.The assembly code for the loop found in the C code.

loop:
    slli t3, t0, 2
    add t4, t1, t3
    lw t5, 0(t4)
    beq t5, x0, exit
    add t6, t2, t3
    sw t5, 0(t6)
    addi t0, t0, 1
    jal x0, loop

4.How the pointers are manipulated in the assembly code.
T1, t2 are used as the constant address of the array. When k increases, the distance between the first element and Kth element is 4 * k, which is the function of this statement "slli t3, t0, 2". And then update the t4 and t6 by adding t3.
